release v0.4

menus:
  compatibility with gnome categories, implies renaming of .directory files
icons:
  what about symlinks:
	if we want them to be displayed correctly in the menu,
	we have to find the icon by mime-type,
	then composite it with the symlink icon and save the result.
	so we should add a mime-type cache to icon_finder with a is_symlink column
  compatibility with GTK3 themes

performance:
	consider using GIO for finding mime-type of files (2x improvement)
    improve directory listing (/usr/bin)

GUI menu editor

launcher:
    integrate with config & config app
    TAB actions:
        show popup if not visible (use token_under_cursor)
        for MODE_APPS ???
    Shift_Tab:
        use token_under_cursor
    ENTER actions:
        ok for basic commands
        think about hashbangs
        launch in terminal:
            Ctrl+Enter (and right-click-on-entry menu) ?
    global edit queue
    performance:
        profile on FIRST RUN, ie after a reboot
        think about running an initialization thread/process in order not to block
        the input while fetching data
    action menus:
        close with LEFT arrow
        actually execute actions
        actions for MODE_BROWSE
	duckduckgo like hashbangs:
		$ => run command
		!w => open url
		!s => search the web
		!py => python docs
		etc...
