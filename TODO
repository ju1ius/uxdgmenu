release v0.4

menus:
  compatibility with gnome categories, implies renaming of .directory files
icons:
  what about symlinks:
	if we want them to be displayed correctly in the menu,
	we have to find the icon by mime-type,
	then composite it with the symlink icon and save the result.
	so we should add a mime-type cache to icon_finder with a is_symlink column
  compatibility with GTK3 themes

performance:
	consider using GIO for finding mime-type of files (2x improvement)
    improve directory listing (/usr/bin)

GUI menu editor

launcher:
    implement the new lexer
	search in $PATH
	duckduckgo like hashbangs:
		$ => run command
		!w => open url
		!s => search the web
		!py => python docs
		etc...
